        "I have chosen to use the \"US Collegiate Sports Dataset\" for my project. I think this dataset is interesting because I'm a huge fan of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team and the SEC Division. I also play Division I lacrosse. I'd like to learn how much football programs contributed to the overall sports revenue at SEC schools in 2019, whether men's lacrosse programs created more revenue at Division I schools than Division II schools in the years 2015 to 2019, and how many women played lacrosse at Division I schools in 2019."

        "The ANOVA results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in the amount of money spent on football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and volleyball at the selected SEC Division I schools in 2019.\n",

        "The ANOVA results combined with a comparison of the mean and mode values for  the selected sports at the selected Division I SEC schools indicates that football might have had the highest sports expenditure in 2019, which is also an indicator that football might have made the highest contribution to sports revenue at Division I SEC schools in 2019.  More analyis is required to determine a more accurate answer.\n",

        "- The results (0.97 coefficient and 0.00 p-value) indicated a strong correlation between the amount of revenue generated by football and the amount of revenue generated by the overall sports programs at those schools."
