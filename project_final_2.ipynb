        "I have chosen to use the \"US Collegiate Sports Dataset\" for my project. I think this dataset is interesting because I'm a huge fan of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team and the SEC Division. I also play Division I lacrosse. I'd like to learn how much football programs contributed to the overall sports revenue at SEC schools in 2019, whether men's lacrosse programs created more revenue at Division I schools than Division II schools in the years 2015 to 2019, and how many women played lacrosse at Division I schools in 2019."

        "According to the course material, the high F-statistic (~ 58.16) indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the expenses for at least two of the sports.  The extremely small p-value means that the evidence against the null hypothesis (that all group means are equal) is extremely strong.\n",

        "The ANOVA results combined with a comparison of the mean and mode values for  the selected sports at the selected Division I SEC schools indicates that football probably had the highest sports expenditure in 2019, which is also an indicator that football might have made the highest contribution to sports revenue at Division I SEC schools in 2019.  More analyis is required to determine a more accurate answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A key part of this analyis was performed in the previous assignment where I used Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis to correlate the amount of revenue generated by football with the total amount of revenue generated by all sports at each selected SEC school in 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The results (0.97 coefficient and 0.00 p-value) indicated a strong correlation between the amount of revenue generated by football and the amount of revenue generated by the overall sports programs at those schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Based on all the tests I performed on the football data, I have a strong opinion that football had the highest revenue, expenses, and contribution to overall sports contribution than basketball, soccer, lacrosse and volleyball."
